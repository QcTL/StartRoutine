# StartRoutine
 Start a group of apps Automatically

Hey,
this is my first app develop with python and tkinter this app is used to create a group of apps that open simultaneously in one click, this groups preserve over time and I created it to easily open all the apps I need to start the day in just one click, hove you find the same utility as me.

How to use it:
#####
First, open the python script StartTheDay, once there you have to create a new bundle of apps,
to create it simply click the new button and a new window will appear.
Once in there, you have to click new and search for the apps that you want to bundle, 
after you finished giving a name to the group, you can click done and navigate with the arrows to the pressed you to want, 
once you want to open all the apps on one preset just press Run.
